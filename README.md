WEATHER API
          This project involves creating a Flask-based web application that utilizes the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data for a specified location. 
          Users will be able to input a city or location name, and the application will display up-to-date weather information, including temperature, humidity, 
          wind speed, and conditions for the specified location. Error handling will be implemented to provide feedback in case of invalid inputs or network issues. 
          The technologies and tools used include Flask for the web framework, the OpenWeather API for weather data retrieval (requiring an API key), 
          basic HTML/CSS for the interface, Python Requests library for making API requests, and JSON parsing to handle API responses.

         This will include to caculate the weather report in 5 days.
